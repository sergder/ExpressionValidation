 * This program validates expressions with symbols '(){}[]' and any other symbol for the right sequence of '(){}[]'. Expressions can be nested into each other. Empty expressions and expressions completely without '(){}[]' are correct

 * Put your expressions into ‘expressions.txt’ and run ‘ExpressionValidation.class’. The results will be in ‘validation_result.txt’

 * Examples:
({kkk}p)() - correct expression
({[qqq]})(}) - incorrect expression
